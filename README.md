### hello everyone!

the name is jade, i code a bunch, play some vide games, [speak in lowercase most of the time](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/AllLowercaseLetters), and enjoy pushing myself to new horizons!

here are some projects i'm proud of in no particular order
* so many plugins lost to time when i played a bunch of minecraft with friends.. good times :')
* i'm helping maintain [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/), a framework for creating behavioral experiments in a browser
  * actively working on eyetracking support, [a cool way to host experiments without a backend](https://pipe.jspsych.org), and much more!
* side projects galore, and i'm always looking for more
  * a soon-to-be-published bejeweled clone just to learn more about game dev
  * a jackbox-style game with a rather unique, artificially intelligent twist
  * very secret and cool projects that i can't talk about yet (but i'm excited for them!)

here are some computer skills that i've pilfered over the years
* languages: java, javascript, typescript, python, r, francais
* frameworks: react, react native, chakra ui, tailwindcss, libgdx
* other skills: (trying to learn more) ux, experience w/ ci/cd, unit testing (junit + jest)
