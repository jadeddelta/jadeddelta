### hello everyone !

i'm jade. i primarily work on [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/) as a core maintainer, but i'm also interested in
* frontend development, either with web-based experiments or through data handling solutions, like [DataPipe](https://github.com/jspsych/datapipe)
* developing AI responsibly, with work on webcam eyetracking
* game development, with my roots in minecraft and java

in my free time, i play a bunch of games, yap online to strangers [in lowercase](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/AllLowercaseLetters),
take long walks and write whatever comes to mind. 
if you'd like to get in contact, my [website](https://jadecode.netlify.app) has relevant links along with my skills. learning is
my lifetime goal, so i enjoy working on what i am unexperienced in- though my established skills lie in python, java, and javascript.
can't wait to meet you!

don't forget to do things the fun way, not the easy way. :>
