### hello everyone!

the name is jade, i code a bunch, play some video games, [speak in lowercase most of the time](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/AllLowercaseLetters), and enjoy pushing myself to new horizons!

here are some projects i'm proud of in no particular order
* so many plugins lost to time when i played a bunch of minecraft with friends.. good times :')
* i'm helping maintain [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/), a framework for creating behavioral experiments in a browser
  * also making [a cool way to host experiments without a backend](https://pipe.jspsych.org)!
* i'm working on a novel solution to eyetracking in the web browser using deep learning.. to be revealed soon 
* side projects galore, always looking for more
  * a simple [quest form generator](https://github.com/jadeddelta/oquest-builder) for the minecraft plugin o'dailyquests
  * a match-3 game written in godot as my own spiritual successor to the bejeweled series of games (rest in peace)
  * silly game jams, including but not limited to a [deep sea tower defense](https://julwang.itch.io/deep-sea-defense) adventure

here are some computer skills that i've pilfered over the years
* languages: java, javascript, typescript, python, r, francais
* frameworks: react, react native, chakra ui, tailwindcss, libgdx
* other skills: (trying to learn more) ux, experience w/ ci/cd, unit testing (junit + jest)
