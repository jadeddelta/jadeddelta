### hello everyone!

the name is jade, i code a bunch, play some vide games, [speak in lowercase most of the time](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Laconic/AllLowercaseLetters), and enjoy pushing myself to new horizons!

here are some projects i'm proud of in no particular order
* i played a bunch of minecraft, so my first start (even before my intro to cs classes) was developing server-side plugins with my friends for the fun of it
* i'm helping maintain [jsPsych](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych/), a framework for creating behavioral experiments in a browser
  * might be working on some eyetracking and a method to simplify the deployment of these experiments, we will see 
* i'm actively looking for new opportunities to contribute to open-source minecraft mods, trying to get into the workflow of that
* mayhaps more . . .

here are some computer skills that i've pilfered over the years
* languages: java, javascript, typescript, python, r, french 
* frameworks: react, react native, chakra ui, tailwindcss
* other skills: (trying to learn more) ux, experience w/ ci/cd, unit testing (junit + jest)
